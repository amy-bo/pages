## Affordable electrobioreactor

The electroPioreactor builds on the well-established [Pioreactor](https://pioreactor.com/) by adding in-culture electrodes and CO₂ sparging, transforming it into an electrobioreactor.

- **In-culture electrodes**  
  - Generate hydrogen (<abbr title="Hydrogen Oxidising Bacteria">HOB</abbr>'s energy source)  
  - Generate oxygen (terminal electron acceptor for aerobic respiration)

- **CO₂ sparging**  
  - Supplies the carbon source for <abbr title="Hydrogen Oxidising Bacteria">HOB</abbr>  
  - Purges excess oxygen to prevent inhibition of electrolysis

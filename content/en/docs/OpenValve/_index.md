## Affordable, open source pinch valve

AMYBO's Harvey Mudd Clinic Valve Team have been designing a 3D printed open source pinch valve housing that can be made using readily available & affordable standard solenoid valves.

We'll be posting their designs here soon.  If it's after 7 May and this page still looks like this please contact [Martin](https://amy.bo/Martin-links).

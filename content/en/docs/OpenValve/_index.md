## Affordable, open source pinch valve

AMYBO's Harvey Mudd Clinic Valve Team have been designing a 3D printed open source pinch valve housing that can be made using readily available & affordable standard solenoid valves.

We're now looking to optimise the pinch valve for use with the [1/16" ID flexible silicone tubing](https://pioreactor.com/collections/accessories-and-parts/products/1-8-od-1-16-id-silicone-tubing) provided with Pioreactors.
